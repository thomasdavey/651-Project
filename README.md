## Note Taking App

This project was created for CSC 651 at SFSU to demonstrate an Express server communicating with a React app and MongoDB.

To install the app, you will need Node.js installed. You will also need a MonogoDB database running on port `27017`. Once you have these, clone the repo and run the following commands.

1. `npm install`
2. `node server.js`
3. `npm start` (in a different terminal)

Finally, visit [localhost](http://localhost:3000) to see the app running.
